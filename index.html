		<h2> High Fashion üë†</h2>

		<h2> Travel üåç</h2>
		<p>
			I love to travel. I was able to go to Asia, the United States, Africa and also visit the four corners of Europe. I had the chance to discover different cultures, civilizations, religions and ways of life. In New York, I was surprised by the architectural and cultural grandeur of Manhattan. I became aware that our world is composed of a multicultural population whose codes are sometimes different and contradictory. I love to travel, but what I prefer is to go in contact with the population and understand their habits and customs. These different destinations have allowed me to develop a certain form of respect for cultural differences. Each continent, each country has a different approach to environmental protection, access to schooling, health care and water, but also to the respect of human rights... His travels have allowed me to learn, to cultivate myself and to build my personal point of view on the society that surrounds us.
